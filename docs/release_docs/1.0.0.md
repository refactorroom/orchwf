## Usage Patterns

### Basic Workflow
```go
stateManager := orchwf.NewInMemoryStateManager()
orchestrator := orchwf.NewOrchestrator(stateManager)

step, _ := orchwf.NewStepBuilder("step1", "Process", executor).Build()
workflow, _ := orchwf.NewWorkflowBuilder("workflow", "My Workflow").AddStep(step).Build()

orchestrator.RegisterWorkflow(workflow)
result, err := orchestrator.StartWorkflow(ctx, "workflow", input, metadata)
```

### Database Persistence
```go
db, _ := sql.Open("postgres", connectionString)
stateManager := orchwf.NewDBStateManager(db)
orchestrator := orchwf.NewOrchestrator(stateManager)
```

### Async Execution
```go
workflowID, err := orchestrator.StartWorkflowAsync(ctx, "workflow", input, metadata)
status, err := orchestrator.GetWorkflowStatus(ctx, workflowID)
```

## Technical Decisions
